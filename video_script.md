# Video Narration Script
## Modern School Management System — Feature Overview (~2.5 minutes)

---

### Slide 1 — Title (4 seconds)
> *[Upbeat, confident tone]*

"Introducing the **Modern School Management System** — a cloud-based, mobile-first platform built to connect every stakeholder in a school into one intelligent digital ecosystem."

---

### Slide 2 — The Problem (7 seconds)
> *[Empathetic, problem-aware tone]*

"Most schools today still rely on paper registers for attendance, manual invoices for fees, and phone calls to reach parents. Data lives in separate places, communication breaks down, and administrators have no way to see the full picture.

The Modern SMS solves all of this — in one unified platform."

---

### Slide 3 — User Roles (6 seconds)
> *[Inclusive, reassuring tone]*

"The system is designed for everyone in the school ecosystem.

Admins get full control over records and configuration. Principals monitor academics and approve communications. Teachers mark attendance and manage homework. Parents receive live updates and pay fees online. And students access materials, view timetables, and submit assignments — all from their phones."

---

### Slide 4 — Architecture (6 seconds)
> *[Technical, confident tone]*

"Under the hood, the system is built on a modern cloud-native architecture.

A React or Flutter frontend connects to a FastAPI backend through a secure API gateway. Every request is authenticated with JWT tokens and enforced with role-based access control. Data is stored in PostgreSQL, files in cloud storage, and the whole system runs on Docker — deployable on AWS or Azure."

---

### Slide 5 — Core Modules (8 seconds)
> *[Clear, feature-focused tone]*

"The core platform covers the essentials schools need from day one.

**Student Management** handles admissions, profiles, and document uploads. **Attendance** supports digital marking via RFID, QR codes, or face scanning — and automatically alerts parents when a student is absent. **Fees and Billing** lets parents pay online with UPI or card, and auto-generates receipts. **Timetable** manages class schedules and substitute assignments. **Exams** handles scheduling, marks entry, grade calculation, and automatic PDF report card generation."

---

### Slide 6 — Learning & Communication (7 seconds)
> *[Engaging, warm tone]*

"Beyond operations, the platform powers learning and communication.

Teachers can post homework with deadlines, students submit photos or PDFs, and teachers provide digital feedback. A content hub stores notes, presentations, and video links by subject. Parents receive automated alerts via SMS, WhatsApp, email, or push notification — for absences, fee dues, exam schedules, and more. And a built-in messaging system lets parents book meetings with teachers directly."

---

### Slide 7 — Facilities (7 seconds)
> *[Matter-of-fact, comprehensive tone]*

"For schools with extended facilities, the platform includes dedicated modules.

**Transport** provides live GPS tracking of buses with pickup and drop alerts to parents. **Library** manages the full book lifecycle — catalog, issue, return, and fines. **Hostel** tracks room allocation, meals, and hostel fees. And **Inventory** manages uniforms, stationery, lab equipment, and supplier purchases — all in one place."

---

### Slide 8 — AI & Analytics (7 seconds)
> *[Innovative, forward-looking tone]*

"What makes this system truly modern is its AI engine.

Rather than just reporting what happened, the system predicts what's about to happen. It identifies students at risk of failing before exams arrive. It flags attendance drop patterns and alerts parents early. It detects slow learners by comparing individual progress to class averages. And it predicts fee defaulters — so the school can follow up proactively. This transforms the ERP from reactive to truly intelligent."

---

### Slide 9 — Security (7 seconds)
> *[Serious, trustworthy tone]*

"Student data is sensitive — and the system takes that seriously.

Every login uses JWT with refresh tokens. Passwords are never stored in plain text — bcrypt hashing is enforced across the board. Every user sees only what their role permits, at both the API and UI level. Admin actions are recorded in full audit logs. Files are scanned on upload, and login endpoints are rate-limited to prevent brute-force attacks."

---

### Slide 10 — Roadmap (8 seconds)
> *[Strategic, clear tone]*

"The system is delivered in four phases, so schools can go live fast and grow over time.

**Phase 1** delivers the MVP: student records, attendance, fees, and parent notifications. **Phase 2** adds homework, timetables, exams, and report cards. **Phase 3** brings transport tracking, library, hostel, and full analytics dashboards. **Phase 4** introduces the AI insights engine, RFID and facial recognition attendance, and multi-school SaaS support with custom branding — ready to serve hundreds of schools on a single platform."

---

### Slide 11 — Closing (5 seconds)
> *[Inspiring, closing tone]*

"Cloud-first. Mobile-first. Secure. Automated. Intelligent.

The Modern School Management System is a complete digital transformation platform for schools of any size — built to scale. Ready when you are."
